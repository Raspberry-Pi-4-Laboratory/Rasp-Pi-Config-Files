# Rasp-Pi-Config-Files
Rasp Pi Config Files for the Raspberry Pi

Place these config Raspberry Pi files in the same folder where your LCD Python drivers are stored.
Keep both the Rasp Pi config files and the Rasp Pi LCD drivers in separate folders. But also keep
them within your Raspberry Pi Python programs folder of choice. I store my Rasp Pi Python programs
within the documents folder. So nest these two folders within your documents folder, or folder of
choice wherever you keep your actual Raspberry Pi Python program files. Do not remove any of these
files from their folder. Nest the whole folder within your documents folder, or wherever you keep
your Raspberry Pi Python program files.
